<p>We can use php to write to a text file. The <em>fwrite</em> function allows data to be written to any type of file. Fwrite's first parameter is the file handle and its second parameter is the string of data that is to be written. Just give the function those two bits of information and you're good to go!</p>
<p>Below we are writing a couple of names into our test file <em>testFile.txt</em> and separating them with a carriaged return.</p>
